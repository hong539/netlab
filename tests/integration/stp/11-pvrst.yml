message: |
  The devices under test form a layer-2 triangle of VLAN trunks. The devices
  are running PVRST and have different per-VLAN root priorities.

  If DUT_A and DUT_B run PVRST and has correct per-VLAN root priorities, DUT_A becomes the
  root bridge for red VLAN and DUT_B becomes the root bridge for the blue VLAN.
